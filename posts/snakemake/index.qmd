Workflow management tools like  [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) have proven incredibly valuable in large-scale bioinformatics analysis. While I don't have a particular preference, I have had extensive experience with Snakemake as a Student Assistant at the [Environmental Sciences Department of Aarhus University](https://envs.au.dk/en/).

Snakemake files are just Python files extended with a declarative sugar syntax like MakeFiles. Unlike traditional Makefiles, it is designed explicitly for scientific workflows. 

In my role, I have focused on automating pipelines for the High-Throughput Sequencing Center of Aarhus University (Roskilde). This has allowed me to delve into working with HPC clusters, employing Singularity containers, and gaining in-depth knowledge of the bioinformatics pipelines.

To date, I have developed in [Snakemake a Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) pipeline](https://github.com/AU-ENVS-Bioinformatics/IlluminaSnakemake) for prokaryotes, a [TotalRNA metatranscriptomics pipeline](https://github.com/AU-ENVS-Bioinformatics/TotalRNA-Snakemake), and one pipeline for [long-amplicon sequencing](https://github.com/AU-ENVS-Bioinformatics/emu-smk) for Oxford Nanopore. My colleagues are using the pipelines, and I look forward to publishing one of the manuscripts that have used it. 

Using [Snakemake wrappers](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), small reusable scripts that facilitate using popular bioinformatics programs, has made my life much easier. When I had the time and saw the opportunity, I contributed with PRs to the snakemake-wrappers repository, improving or adding new features :)

I have made all of my code publicly available on GitHub. I am very grateful to be in a work environment encouraging Free software. I always continue to be impressed by the open contributions of the scientific community to bioinformatics.  

If you are more interested, I invite you to look at the organization's repository (<https://github.com/AU-ENVS-Bioinformatics/>).
