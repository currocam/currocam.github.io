Last summer, I took the PhD course *Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis* at the Bioinformatics Research Centre, Aarhus University. We had a super exciting poster session as part of the course, and I just wanted to share mine here!

I created a poster on a Whole-Genome sequencing + genome mining pipeline for isolates from environmental samples using Illumina.
