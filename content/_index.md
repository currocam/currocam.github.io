Hi! I’m Curro Campuzano Jiménez. I’m a PhD student at [Svardal Lab](https://svardallab.wordpress.com). I’m interested in the usage of genomic data to study evolution and scientific computing. Currently, I’m digging into the study of speciation and probability theory.


I did my master’s thesis at Aarhus University with [Thomas Bataillon](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/tbata%40birc.au.dk) in prediction of maladaptation due to climate change while I worked as a bioinformatician at the [AU-ENVS department](https://envs.au.dk/en/).
