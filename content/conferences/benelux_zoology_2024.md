Here is a link to the [poster I brought to the Benelux Zoology Congress 2024 (Zoology2024) at Mons (Belgium)](/benelux_zoology2024.pdf). I presented preliminary results on the demographic history and dispersal of two closely related silverside species in Lake Matano. I found almost identical demographic histories in _T. opudi_ and _T. sarasinorum_, which questions their species status. I also didn't find evidence of isolation by distance in the lake.
