title = 'A Chromosome-level assembly of Thymus vulgaris'
+++

As part of my Master's program at [BiRC](https://birc.au.dk/), I worked with [Thomas Bataillon](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4730-2538) to use PacBio HiFi reads to obtain a chromosome-level assembly of Mediterranean thyme.

The primary objective was to use the genome of a closely related species to improve the contiguity of the highly fragmented *de novo* assembly. Although further research is required, we achieved promising results. For example, we increased the N50 from 1.87 Mb (n=133) at the contig level to 48.92 Mb (n=8) at the scaffold level.

All the code and the slides I used for the project defense are publicly available on GitHub, which you can access at <https://currocam.github.io/BiRC-Thyme>/
