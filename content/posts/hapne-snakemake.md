HapNe is a haplotype-based method to infer recent effective population size ($N_e$). As part of my own research on inferring recent $N_e$, I developed a Snakemake workflow that adapts HapNe to work with non-human datasets. The original implementation required the input data to come from a human reference genome. My implementation might be useful for people working on conservation genomics and non-model organisms in general.
